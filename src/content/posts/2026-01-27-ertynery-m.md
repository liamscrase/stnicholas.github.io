Our parish gathered in the warmth of the season to celebrate the Incarnation of our Lord. From the moving chants of the Vigil to the triumphant Festal Liturgy, the spirit of Bethlehem was truly present in our community.

After the service, we shared a festive meal, enjoying the abundance of the summer harvest and the joy of breaking the fast together. Thank you to the choir, the servers, and everyone who made this feast a beautiful homecoming.
