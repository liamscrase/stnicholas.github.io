There are moments in the life of a parish that stay with you long after the candles have been extinguished and the vestments folded away. Our recent journey to Lake Tekapo was one of them.

A group from our community at St Nicholas Orthodox Church made the trip inland to the Church of the Good Shepherd, that little stone chapel sitting quietly on the edge of Lake Tekapo — one of the most iconic and beloved church buildings in all of New Zealand. We had come not simply as tourists, but as Orthodox Christians to serve the Divine Liturgy within its walls, and what a privilege it was.

## Braving the Elements

The Mackenzie Basin did not offer us its famous blue skies and sunshine on this occasion. The weather was thoroughly uncooperative — wind whipping off the lake, rain sweeping across in grey curtains — and yet this seemed only to add to the sense of occasion. There is something ancient and fitting about gathering for worship in difficult conditions, something that connects us to the generations of Christians who have always sought God not despite the hardships of the world, but right in the middle of them.

And the view — even under heavy cloud — was spectacular. Lake Tekapo stretched out beside us in its extraordinary turquoise stillness, the mountains looming in and out of the mist behind. Even the rain could not diminish it. If anything, the moody skies made the landscape feel more dramatic, more alive, and somehow more fitting as a backdrop for the Liturgy we were about to celebrate.

## The Divine Liturgy

To serve the Divine Liturgy in the Church of the Good Shepherd was a deeply moving experience. The little building, with its famous east-facing window framing the lake and the mountains beyond, created an atmosphere unlike anywhere else. As the prayers rose and the familiar words of the Liturgy filled that small space, it felt as though the beauty of creation outside the window and the worship taking place within were one single act of praise to God.

We give thanks to all who participated — those who sang, those who served, and those who simply came and prayed. Each one made the Liturgy what it was.

## Fellowship and Warmth

After the service, the fellowship continued in the most wonderful way. We were warmly welcomed to lunch at the home of the parents of one of our congregation members, and their generosity and hospitality were truly a gift. Good food, warm company, laughter, and conversation — the perfect way to round off a day that had already given us so much. This is the Church not just at the altar, but at the table, and it is just as important.

## Gratitude

We are grateful to everyone who made the day possible — to our hosts for their extraordinary hospitality, to all who made the journey, and to God for the gift of community, of worship, and even of wild, rainy, spectacular days in the mountains of the South Island.

May the Good Shepherd continue to guide and gather us together.
